## About the book

The 2nd Edition of Keycloak – Identity and Access Management for Modern Applications is a refreshed, comprehensive introduction to Keycloak and its updates.

In this new edition, you will learn how to use the latest distribution of Keycloak. The recent versions of Keycloak are now based on Quarkus, which brings a new and improved user experience and a new admin console with a higher focus on usability. You will see how to leverage Spring Security, instead of the Keycloak Spring adapter, while using the latest distribution of Keycloak. As you progress, you will come to understand the new Keycloak distribution and explore best practices for using OAuth. Finally, you'll cover more general best practices and other information on how to protect your applications.

By the end of this new edition, you will have learned how to install and manage the latest version of Keycloak to secure new and existing applications using the newest features.

## What's New (pending)

Unlike the previous edition of this book, which covered Keycloak as deployed on top of WildFly, a JavaEE Application Server, this edition of [Keycloak – Identity and Access Management for Modern Applications](https://www.packtpub.com/product/keycloak-identity-and-access-management-for-modern-applications-second-edition/9781804616444), focusses on the more recent versions of Keycloak which are built with Quarkus, a cloud native Java framework. Being based on Quarkus brings a number of improvements, reducing startup time significantly, reducing memory footprint, and most importantly bringing a much simpler and more consistent approach to configuring Keycloak.

Another big change to Keycloak, which is explored in this edition, is the new admin console which has a much bigger focus on usability than the previous console.

### Chapter 01, Getting Started with Keycloak (This is pending)
Keycloak, an open-source Identity and Access Management tool, is introduced in three parts. The initial segment emphasizes its relevance to modern apps and its installation process, with Docker and OpenJDK options highlighted. Part two elaborates on installation specifics, underlining Keycloak's lightweight design, scalability, and seamless integration with various identity systems. Part three delves into advanced configurations, discussing realms, users, groups, roles, and the user-centric account console. Key takeaways include Keycloak's adaptability for modern apps, its flexibility through customization, and its commitment to enhancing security via various authentication methods. These segments collectively establish the foundation for understanding, installing, and configuring Keycloak for effective application security.
