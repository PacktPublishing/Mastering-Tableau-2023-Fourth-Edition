## What's New (pending)

[  Unlike the previous edition of this book, which covered Keycloak as deployed on top of WildFly, a JavaEE Application Server, this edition of [Mastering Tableau 2023](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-tableau-2023-fourth-edition/9781803233765), focusses on the more recent versions of Keycloak which are built with Quarkus, a cloud native Java framework. Being based on Quarkus brings a number of improvements, reducing startup time significantly, reducing memory footprint, and most importantly bringing a much simpler and more consistent approach to configuring Keycloak.

Another big change to Keycloak, which is explored in this edition, is the new admin console which has a much bigger focus on usability than the previous console.  ]  To be updated
